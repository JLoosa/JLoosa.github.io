        Hello, my name is Jacob Loosa, and I am a student at The University of Texas at El Paso.
        I am in my senior year of undergrad and will be graduating with my bachelor of science in computer science in mid-2021.

        Eventually, I will put some more information about myself here.
        I am not entirely sure what I would like to put yet.
