            Hello, my name is Jacob, and I am a student at The University of Texas at El Paso.
            <br><br>
            This site may grow to be a webpage dedicated to myself, but it still has a long way to go.
            I have chosen to use GitHub Pages for as the site host for two main reasons:
            (1) I already have experience using GitHub and its repositories, and (2) The service is free.
            <br><br>
            My hope is to slowly put information on here that makes me look good.
            The problem is that I have not worked very much in the domain of web development, so many of the things that I create are going to be bland.
            Additionally, many of my old projects where written in languages such as Java or Python, which cannot be hosted and displayed on the web as easily as JavaScript.
            The final problem I have is that a lot of my work was never posted to GitHub and then, eventually, became lost to time.
            This means that some projects that I have completed in the past are missing and cannot be used as an example of what I have accomplished.<br>

        </p>
